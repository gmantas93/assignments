###1. Introduction
___
Over the last years, women have increasingly managed to both, enter in traditional male occupations[1] and increase their participation in the labor force. As a result, the gender pay gap has diminished significantly, especially during 1985 – 2000 period (Blau and Kahn, 2000). However, efforts still need to be carried out to achieve wage equity. Figure 1 shows the ratio of women to men’s earnings in the United States for the 1990-2015 period. During the 1990’s significant progress was done in narrowing the wage differences, however, the rate of convergence towards equal pay has slowed down during the last ten years and its narrowing is not likely to continue in the future[2].

Given the persistent and distortive nature of the gender wage gap, active policies and positive measures are required to enhance pay equity. In order to construct feasible and efficient policies, the sources and the reasons of the wage gap should be explored.  Formally, we will define the gender wage gap (or gender pay gap) as a measure the of earnings differences between women and men in paid employment in the labor market. It is one of the many indicators of gender inequality in a country (Education International, 2005, pp. 1).

The differences in wages between men and women lead to undesired outcomes. These differentials may arise in three possible situations: women generally earn less than men, women earn less than men in the same occupation or women earn less than men for jobs that have the same requirements. All three scenarios are particularly important as they clearly exemplify a source of discrimination and disadvantage for women in comparable working contexts. 

The economic literature has not defined a specific cause for the gender wage gap, however, in this paper we will focus on two of them: occupational segregation and direct gender discrimination. After discussing the implications of these two factors, we analyze public policy tools (specially the use of quotas) as a mechanism to reduce the gender wage gap.  

###2. Gender Wage Gap and Occupational Segregation
___

Occupational or employment segregation[3] is an expression for the gendered division of labor in paid employment, where men and women are channeled into different types of occupational roles and tasks (Hegewisch and Hartmann, 2014). A careful analysis of the occupational segregation and gender earnings ratio shows that these two variables have an inverse correlation (Figure 2). The Index of occupational segregation is calculated using the methodology proposed by Duncan and Duncan (1955), where a value of 1 implies that the occupation is completely segregated. Hence, as the Index of Occupational Segregation diminishes and approaches zero (the labour market becomes more occupationally integrated), the relative earnings of women with respect to their male counterparts increase.

It is apparent that the occupational segregation affects negatively the earnings of genders since it splits the labor market into predominantly male and female occupations. Moreover, females face a wage penalty (workers earn less money than their counterparts in jobs that require the exact same skills and responsibilities) as female occupations usually are paid less. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show a group of selected occupations and the proportion of women that work in them. As it can be seen in Figure 4, women’s wages in male-dominated occupations are particularly low compared to their male counterparts, but also for female-dominated jobs the wage gap still exists.

Occupational segregation is linked to various observable aspects that are related with the skills, educational level and preferences of women in the labor market. However, most of these observable characteristics do not justify the existence of a wage gap. In this context it is useful to analyze occupational segregation under the optics of social norms. Social norms can have such a powerful effect, that they may increase segregation and impact negatively the gender wage gap.

The first observed social norm that preserves this gender bias relates to the motherhood of women and their role as care takers, both of kids and adults. The former not only affects the behavior of women, by leading them to search primarily for part-time jobs when there are parental duties, but also affects the education system and the basic public labor authorities. This polarization of the labor market is reflected by the general channeling of women to relevant working areas with child care and children in general. In fact, 98% of the preschool and kindergarten teachers and 75% of the healthcare practitioners in the U.S. in 2015 were women (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2016). Due to the characteristics of the social environment mentioned above, gender integration is hindered across occupations and this leads to a fundamental undervaluation of women’s work.

Secondly, employers are affected by adjusting their behavior towards female workers. More specifically, women are often considered as “potential mothers” who will plausibly interrupt their careers. Figure 5 uses data from the Pew Research Center (2013) to show the percentage of women who adapted their careers because they had to take care of a family member. It is evident that women are more likely than men to suffer professionally due to family responsibilities. As consequence, employers tend to give lower wages to female workers (both full-time and part-time) since they fear women will leave the workplace eventually or will be less willing to sacrifice personal time to fulfill professional duties. Therefore, it is profound how a social norm can contribute to the employers’ behavior and how women’s work tends to be under valuated in the labor market and extensively to the whole society. Figure 6 shows the percentage of working parents that believe that being a parent makes it harder/easier to advance in their jobs or career. It is clear that women are the largely affected by parenthood, especially when kids are still young. 

In previous decades, when each gender had a defined role in society, employers would statistically discriminate their employees (Bielby and Baron, 1986). Statistical discrimination implies that employers would simply assume that all women were, on average, the same. The latter, in turn, lead to occupational segregation, meaning that some occupations were mainly carried out by women, while others were done predominantly by men (Hegewisch et al., 2010). This vicious cycle of statistical discrimination and occupational segregation, has made it hard for women to achieve wage parity. Moreover, it is a matter closely linked to the beliefs the employers and employees have regarding the “suitability” of a woman for certain occupations, which should be addressed from a behavioral economics point of view.

###3.	Direct Gender Discrimination
___

The second cause for the gender wage gap that we are going to discuss is direct gender discrimination in the labor market. 

From recent studies, it is known that direct gender discrimination is a phenomenon that involves nearly all the occupational fields (Hegewisch & Hartmann, 2014) and deals with implicit social norms. As the differences in education level out and more women complete higher (tertiary) education (Figure 7), it is surprising that the earnings gap still exists. Given that social and education patterns have changed; it is still hard to justify the use of statistical discrimination by employers. Thus, the segregation in occupations may be due to the imposition of entry barriers for women (Levine, 2004), which is not so easy to overcome. If employers have certain degree of rejection towards women (say, taste-based discrimination), the educational gains that women have achieved and their new career perspectives will not be enough to reach a wage ratio equal to 1. Taste-based discrimination arises when the employer does not like women and feels that (s)he is paying more to his/her female employers than what (s)he is actually paying. In this case, the wage premium that men perceive is justified by the feeling that women are getting a higher wage compared to what they are actually receiving.

Discrimination can be seen in terms of wages, promotions (glass ceiling), hiring procedures (Goldin and Rouse, 2000), among others. As shown in Figure 8 and Figure 9, women tend to be more affected by discrimination in the workplace than their male counterparts. In this paper, we will focus on discrimination in terms of wages. That is, even after taking out the differences related to the nature of the job, its requirements, the necessary skills, and all the other characteristics, also related to the workers, male wages are higher than women’s. In order to analyze these wage differences from a theoretical point of view, a wage-decomposition approach is usually used. This method allows to measure the amount of direct discrimination in wages in a field or sector. Furthermore, it describes the existence of an explained gap in wage, which is built by collecting the differences in observable characteristics linked to both the job and the employee (for instance: economic sector, how many years of occupation in the same sector, college major, GPA, hours worked, etc.), and un unexplained gap, which is commonly interpreted as an estimate of the discrimination on women’s earnings. As an example, Hill (2014) found that there is a 7% wage gap between the earnings, in the year after graduation, of male with respect to women and that it jumps to 12% after 10 years, however, this gap cannot be justified by any statistical reason.

Linking the two causes that we address in this paper, O’Neill and O’Neill (2005) mention that women tend to work more part-time and less weeks (total) than men, which has a negative effect on wages. In fact, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, women worked, on average, 5 hours less per week than men in 2015. The latter may be related to the fact that women tend to take breaks due to family responsibilities and thus, select jobs that offer some flexibility. The effect of statistical and direct discrimination can be seen in Correll et al. (2007). The authors’ results show that evaluators (in the experiment) tend to rate mothers as less competent and less committed than non-mothers, while prospective employers called back non-mothers more often than mothers. These outcomes, however, did not apply to fathers and non-fathers.

So, is discrimination an optimal decision from the companies’ point of view? According to Noland et al. (2016), the inclusion of women in higher positions increases the firm’s performance and skill base, giving room for further growth. Moreover, Weber and Zulehner (2009) carried out an analysis of startups survival rates based on the share of female employees. Their results show that firms that discriminate (have lower a percentage of women in their workforce compared to the industry average), tend to have lower survival rates. It is hard, if not impossible, to find an objective reason that would justify that women are kept out of certain occupations, especially those that have the higher wages. Furthermore, from a theoretical point of view it is not possible to justify the differences in wages.

The introduction of public policies is a possible solution to the gender-based discrimination in the labor market. Some proponents state that the use of comparable worth policies should be a good start. Comparable worth implies that people doing equivalent jobs (have the same requirements, responsibilities, and attributes) should receive the same wage (Levine, 2004). Although in theory it is a good idea, the implementation and assumptions behind are hard and unpractical. Another policy tool can be the use of shared jobs.


###4. Gender Wage Gap Reduction-Public Policy
___
The introduction of public policies is a possible solution to the gender-based discrimination in the labor market. Some proponents state that the use of comparable worth policies should be a good start. Comparable worth implies that people doing equivalent jobs (have the same requirements, responsibilities, and attributes) should receive the same wage (Levine, 2004). Although in theory it is a good idea, the implementation and assumptions behind are hard and unpractical. Another way to improve the earnings of female-dominated jobs is through a (higher) minimum wage to be imposed in female-dominated jobs. As in the case of the comparable worth, it is unlikely that a policy proposal that involves a specific minimum wage to certain occupations based on segregation will be approved by the policy makers. More adequate policies include better parental leave policies[4], paid sick days for women and the introduction of seminars for employers as a way to show them the real value of women’s work (Hegewisch and Hartmann, 2014 and Education International, 2005).

As mentioned before, it might be hard to implement an effective national wide policy, however, some simple actions can be taken to reduce the level of discrimination in the labor market. For instance, the US Office of Personnel Management makes public the salaries and range of wages for each level of the Federal workers, it also provides additional information regarding the areas in which the cost of living is particularly high. This policy has helped reduce the gap close to zero and contributes to create a fairer working environment. Given that in many situations women are discouraged, or even explicitly forbidden, to discuss salary rises, Hill (2014) observed that this situation occurs less frequently in the public sector (14% reported by interviewed) with respect to the private sector (61%).

Moreover, the White House Equal Pay Pledge (2009), announced and signed by the President Obama administration (now a law), forces the employers of the private sector companies to commit to guarantee an equal pay for their employees. It has been signed and adopted by many big companies such as Facebook, American Airlines, General Motors and Apple.

###4.1 Quotas as Policy Tool
___
A quota is a fixed number or percentage of minority group members needed to meet the requirements of affirmative action. In the context of gender inequality in the labor markets, it simply implies that a fixed percentage of job-positions being reserved for women.

This leads to the question, why are quotas necessary? Argumentatively, the answer is quite simple – it is an effort to reduce discrimination faced by women in the workplace. As mentioned earlier, women all around the world face a variety of issues in the workplace, ranging from unequal pay to sexual harassment. Imposition of quotas seeks to alleviate or reduce the effect of these issues by improving the representation of women in the workplace.

The above-mentioned issues highlight the need for affirmative action on the part of governments and policy makers to reduce gender discrimination in the workplace. As stated in Balafoutas and Sutter (2010), out of the three most commonly used ‘tools’ - quotas, preferential treatment and ‘competition repetition’ -  it has been shown that quotas are indeed the most effective and do not have negative consequences as far as other workers in the firm are concerned, thereby making them good policy prescriptions. However, a potential caveat does exist – economic experiments that seek to replicate real-life scenarios may not always reflect what works in actual practice. This is not the result of any underlying ‘flaw’ in the experiment itself, but rather the fact that workplace related scenarios are often highly nuanced and it is not possible to capture these specific details in a single experiment.

Given the nature of societal problem like gender discrimination, it is also necessary to approach it from a moral/ethical perspective. From the policy-makers’ perspective, there are two possible arguments that serve as a form of reasoning to alleviate inequality and discrimination:

* Ensuring equality of outcome – The primary objective of the policy maker is to ensure that all the involved groups end up with equal outcomes. This is a sort of ‘last-stage’ policy where the target variable, so to say is directly sought to be changed.  The underlying causes and mechanism that lead to inequality in such a policy decision are often ignored, often in the interest of feasibility and time.

* Ensuring equality of opportunity – This form of reasoning, on the other hand seeks to treat the underlying mechanism that leads to inequality in the first place.

The primary objective is to induce a level-playing field upon which (equal) individuals compete to produce optimal outcome. This resonates closely to the idea of ‘laissez-faire’ wherein the underlying issue cause of inequality is treated, rather than the outcome. For the given context of gender discrimination, the use of quotas is an example of a policy which seeks to equalize the outcome - the lack of female labor force participation and gender based discrimination in the workplace. On the other hand, a corresponding policy that seeks to equalize outcomes in the scenario would be, say, a policy which seeks to reverse the societal norms that discriminate against women.

Traditionally, it has been the view that equalizing opportunities is preferable to equalizing outcomes, purely because it implies that the underlying causes of inequality are also treated (Roemer and Trannoy 2013). This is particularly true as far as law and policy makers are concerned (Arneson 2015). However, as Phillips (2005) mentions, the very reason that one might try and balance outcomes is the fact that opportunities are in fact not equal and to change them by way of policy is beyond the bounds of possibility.

For the purpose of examining the consequences of quotas in real life scenarios, we take into account two scenarios where quotas have often been implemented – politics and private corporations. 

1) Political leadership – The UN-led Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women: Action for Equality, Development and Peace, 15 September 1995 argued for quota policies by calling for all international governments to “ensure equal representation of women at all decision-making levels in national and international institutions.” This set up a precedent for several federal governments across the world. In the form of both voluntary and compulsory quotas, governments across the world started to increase female representation in the sphere of politics

While quotas do not have any immediate consequences in the form of equalizing outcomes, it has been shown that they lead to improved attitudes of both political leaders and voters in ways that can reduce the need for such quotas in the long run (Ford and Pande 2011).

2) Corporate board leadership -  The idea of having quotas for women in the corporate workplace is relatively novel, especially when compared to the political sphere. Nevertheless, there does exist substantial amount of literature on quotas that have been implemented in corporate boards across countries. Norway, Spain and Germany are examples of countries that have successfully added mandates for gender based quotas. Responses have been overwhelmingly positive as far as participation is concerned. This leads to conclude that there is no _unwillingness_ on the part of women to work in positions of leadership. Moreover, it has been shown that there are no adverse effects of having women as decision makers in corporate organizations. On the contrary, the evidence seems the suggest that it actually leads to better short-term outcomes for workers (Ford and Pande 2011).

###5. Conclusion
___
Even though women have made huge gains in their educational attainment and have massively joined the workforce over the last several decades, they are still paid less than men. There is good evidence that discrimination contributes to the persistent pay disparity between men and women.

From the above presentation, it is profound that approaching an equal pay between both genders will benefit the society. In particular, Costa and Silva (2008) constructed an economic model which predicts that by diminishing gender wage gap and increasing participation of women in the labor market will have positive effects in the whole economy. The authors mentioned improved economic growth, alleviation of poverty, reduction of inequality and various beneficial results for both genders regardless their age as possible spillovers from a more equal labor market (Education International, 2005). Furthermore, studies have shown that even if occupational integration has been achieved in certain occupations, there is still much to be done, particularly in low-paying occupations where the gap in wages is still persistent (Goldin, 2014). The analysis has proved that this persistent discrimination is irrational, because gender equality achieves higher profits and better work environments. Finally, considering the perspectives about the gender gap, it can be said that there are still plenty of issues that require policy implementation and investigation in order to ameliorate further the working conditions of women.
